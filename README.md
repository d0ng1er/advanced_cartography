## System Requirements

- Windows 8.1 or newer, 64 bit
- Extra hard drive space to store images and maps (must be same drive you have Noita on)
- 4 GB or more of RAM
- Willingness to play in windowed mode (real windowed, where you can see the borders)
- Everything else you need to play Noita (in particular, a good CPU)

## Usage

- Get Noita
- Download mod ([latest release build here](https://github.com/d0ng1er/advanced_cartography/releases)), get the `ac_x.x.x` zip file not the source code.
- Unpack mod into your `mods` folder in Noita (path should be `..\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods\advanced-cartography`)
- Open Noita, in `Mods` select `Enable Unsafe Mods` and then enable the AC mod
- Play the game in windowed mode (fully-windowed, where you can see the borders, NOT fullscreen-windowed). AC will take screenshots as you play.
- In the mod root folder there is an application called `stitcher`. Run that. It will take some time to load.
    - It will open a command prompt which will guide you through the process of stitching the screenshots into a full map.
    - If you keep stitcher open while you play, you will be able to redraw and review the map during the game, allowing you to check for unexplored areas and find items you left behind.
- Screenshots are saved in the `raws` folder, drawn maps are stored in the `maps` folder.
- Screenshots are automatically scaled to the virtual dimensions of the game (not the resolution of the window, the actual number of pixels that Noita is calculating and displaying). This is done to maintain consistent coordinates and keep file sizes manageable. **For the best results, your real resolution should be a multiple of your virtual resolution**.
    - Virtual resolution can be found by looking at the games' `Magic Numbers` in an unpacked `data` file. If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it, the quality will still be fine. 
- Worlds are sorted by seed, and automatically tagged when they are Daily Runs or Daily Practice runs
- When you die, AC will take a screenshot of the final frame of your life
- If you enter a New Game +, a new seed folder is created with the appropriate tag, and the old one remains the same
- You will have to delete the screenshot and map folders manually, depending on how often you play they can still become very large very fast despite compression.

## Planned Features

- ~~Mod setting which allows you to control size of screenshot deadzone.~~ 
- ~~Advanced stitch function~~, integration with mod GUI (stitch and view maps from the pause menu, instead of an external .exe)
    - Noita's modding API might not allow this
- ~~Multithreaded screenshot compression~~
